# Caching
Hands-on Exercises
Simple Cache Implementation:

Implement a basic in-memory cache in Go using a map and implement set, get, and delete operations.
Add a simple expiration mechanism using a goroutine that periodically cleans up expired items.
Redis Integration:

Set up a Redis server and integrate it into a simple Go application.
Implement caching for an API response using Redis.
Experiment with different data structures in Redis (e.g., strings, hashes, lists, sets).
Cache Invalidation:

Implement a mechanism to invalidate the cache when the underlying data changes. For example, when updating a database record, ensure the corresponding cache entry is invalidated.
Implement a write-through cache where writes are done to both the cache and the database.
Distributed Cache:

Set up a distributed cache using Redis in a cluster mode.
Implement a consistent hashing mechanism to distribute keys across multiple nodes.
Cache-aside Pattern:

Implement the cache-aside pattern where the application code explicitly loads data into the cache.
Use this pattern in a more complex application, such as an e-commerce site where product details are cached.
Write-back and Write-through Caches:

Implement a write-back cache where data is written to the cache first and then asynchronously written to the database.
Compare and contrast it with a write-through cache.
Benchmarking and Performance Testing:

Implement a benchmarking suite to measure the performance of different caching strategies.
Test the impact of cache hits and misses on application performance.
